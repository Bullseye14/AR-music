# Music Tiles AR Prototype
### by Pol Casa√∫ and Albert Robles

## How to use

Prepare the marker that you have inside the Google Drive folder or inside Assets/Scripts in the project folder. You can either print it or have it on a screen. With the application opened, point the camera at the marker for it to appear on the screen and you will be seeing the tiles from a piano above it. Touching a tile will play a piano sound, a different note for each one of the tiles. To change the instrument playing, just click on the button that appears on the right top of the screen. There are 3 instruments available: piano, guitar and trumpet.
